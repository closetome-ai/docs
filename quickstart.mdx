## Overview

Closetome is a **permissionless** enhanced X402 endpoint that requires no API keys or registration to use. Anyone can submit transactions to the network and benefit from atomic execution guarantees.

<Note>
Closetome is currently under active development. SDK and implementation details will be available soon.
</Note>

## Key Concepts

### Permissionless Design

Unlike traditional payment gateways, Closetome operates as a completely open protocol:

- **No API Keys Required**: Submit transactions directly to the network
- **No Registration Process**: Start using immediately without signup
- **Open Network**: Anyone can participate as a user or Facilitator
- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions and fees are publicly visible

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Submission">
    Submit your X402 payment transaction to any Closetome endpoint
  </Step>
  <Step title="Atomic Execution">
    Smart contracts ensure payment and callback execute atomically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Routing">
    Transactions are routed to optimal Facilitators via the mempool
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Everything settles in a single blockchain transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture Components

### 1. Atomic Endpoint

The core innovation that solves X402's consistency problems:

```
Standard X402:  Payment → Validation → Settlement (2 phases, 2 transactions)
Closetome:      Payment + Callback → Atomic Execution (1 phase, 1 transaction)
```

### 2. Decentralized Mempool

A public transaction pool where Facilitators compete to process transactions:

- **Market-based fees**: Facilitators set their own rates
- **Performance-based routing**: Better performing nodes get more traffic
- **No central coordinator**: Fully decentralized operation

### 3. MCP Server Integration

Model Context Protocol server providing AI Agents with DeFi capabilities:

- Swap tokens across DEXs
- Manage liquidity positions
- Execute lending strategies
- Bridge assets cross-chain

## Use Cases

### AI Agent Payments

AI Agents can use Closetome to:
- Pay for API services atomically
- Execute DeFi strategies with payment guarantees
- Manage treasury operations safely

### Micropayment APIs

Service providers can:
- Charge per-request without payment risk
- Implement usage-based pricing models
- Ensure payment atomicity for critical operations

### DeFi Automation

Automated systems can:
- Execute complex multi-step transactions atomically
- Ensure all operations succeed or all fail
- Eliminate partial execution risks

## Network Participation

### As a User

Simply submit transactions to any Closetome endpoint:

```
POST https://endpoint.closetome.io/atomic
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "payment": {
    "amount": "1000000000000000",
    "token": "ETH",
    "recipient": "0x..."
  },
  "callback": {
    "contract": "0x...",
    "method": "processPayment",
    "params": [...]
  }
}
```

### As a Facilitator

Join the network to process transactions and earn fees:

1. **Stake tokens** to join the Facilitator registry
2. **Run a node** to process transactions
3. **Earn fees** based on performance and reliability

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IAtomicX402 {
    // Core atomic execution function
    function executeAtomic(
        PaymentInfo calldata payment,
        CallbackInfo calldata callback
    ) external returns (bytes memory);

    // Batch operations for efficiency
    function executeBatch(
        PaymentInfo[] calldata payments,
        CallbackInfo[] calldata callbacks
    ) external returns (bytes[] memory);
}
```

### Transaction Format

All transactions follow the standard X402 format with Closetome extensions:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "payment": {
    // Standard X402 payment fields
  },
  "callback": {
    // Closetome atomic callback specification
  },
  "routing": {
    // Optional: Facilitator preferences
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

- All contracts are audited and formally verified
- Reentrancy protection on all functions
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Economic Security

- Facilitators must stake tokens to participate
- Slashing for malicious behavior
- Fee market ensures competitive pricing

### Network Security

- Decentralized architecture prevents single points of failure
- Transparent mempool prevents censorship
- Open source code for community verification
