## Why Closetome?

### 🔒 **Solving Atomicity Issues**
The standard X402 protocol's two-phase commit model creates serious consistency risks. Closetome completes validation and settlement in a single blockchain transaction, eliminating race conditions entirely.

### ⚖️ **Enhancing Network Resilience**
While top Facilitators frequently experience overload, long-tail resources remain idle. Closetome's decentralized mempool achieves dynamic load balancing, fully utilizing network resources.

### 🚀 **Lowering Development Barriers**
AI Agent developers no longer need to repeatedly implement on-chain interaction logic. Our MCP Server provides plug-and-play DeFi functionality integration.
